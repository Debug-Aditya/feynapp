It's discovered evidence of ancient lakes and rivers on Mars, and it's still actively exploring the planet today!\n\nAnd then there's the Europa Clipper mission, which is set to launch in the mid-2020s. It'll explore Jupiter's icy moon Europa, which is thought to have a liquid water ocean beneath its surface. Who knows what kind of alien life forms we might discover?!\n\nSpace exploration is an amazing field that's constantly pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding.
